      title: Projects
      text: I am highly interested in AI, machine learning, and generative AI projects. I developed a "Chat with PDF" application that uses advanced AI models to interact with PDF documents, making document search and retrieval efficient and user-friendly. My AI/ML projects on GitHub and fine-tuned models on Hugging Face showcase my practical skills and dedication. These projects have greatly enhanced my knowledge and passion for innovation in this exciting field.
